                Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by
chronic abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating, and changes in bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, or
both). It is common disease and affects the large intestine but does not cause permanent damage or
increase the risk of other digestive diseases.

                    1. Gut-Brain axis:
                  </strong>
                  Gut-Brain axis: Miscommunication between the brain and the gut can lead to altered bowel
                  function and sensitivity.

                    <li>
                  <strong>2. Abnormal Intestinal Motility:
                    </strong>   People with IBS may experience abnormal muscle contractions in
                    the intestines, leading to diarrhea (increased contractions) or constipation (slower contractions).
                    </li>

                  <strong>
                      3. Increased Gut Sensitivity: </strong> The intestinal lining may be more sensitive, leading to pain or
                    discomfort from normal gut activity (like gas or stool movement).
                    </li>


                    <li>
                  <strong>4. Gut Microbiota Imbalance:
                    </strong>   An imbalance in the gut bacteria (dysbiosis) may contribute to IBS
                    symptoms.

                  <strong>6. Food Sensitivities:

gluten, fatty foods, and foods high in FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
monosaccharides, and polyols).

                  <strong>6. Stress and Psychological Factors:
                    </strong>  Stress and anxiety can exacerbate IBS symptoms, as the gut is
                    sensitive to emotional changes.
                    </li>

                    <li>

                    <li>
                    IBS is diagnosed primarily based on symptoms and by ruling out other conditions. The Rome IV criteria is
used, which includes abdominal pain at least one day per week in the last three months, associated with
two or more of the following:
                    </li>
                    <li> Pain related to defecation</li>

<li>Changes in stool frequency</li>
<li>Changes in stool form (appearance)</li>
<li>Tests such as blood tests, stool tests, and colonoscopy may be done to exclude other conditions like
celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or infections.</li>

                  <strong>1.Dietary and Lifestyle Changes:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Low FODMAP Diet:
                      </strong>  A diet low in fermentable carbohydrates can reduce IBS symptoms.
                      </li>


                      <li><strong>Increase Fiber (for IBS-C):
                      </strong>   Soluble fiber (like psyllium) can help with constipation, but insoluble
                      fiber (like wheat bran) may worsen symptoms.
                      </li>


                      <li><strong>Avoid Trigger Foods:
                      </strong>   Foods that aggravate symptoms, such as dairy, fatty foods, caffeine,
                      alcohol, and spicy foods, should be avoided.
                      </li>

                      <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:
                      </strong>  Drinking plenty of water helps with constipation.

                      <li><strong>Regular Exercise:

                      </strong>   These medications (e.g., hyoscine, dicyclomine) can relieve abdominal

                      <li><strong>Bile Acid Sequestrants (for IBS-D):
                      </strong>   These reduce diarrhea by binding excess bile acids.

                      <li><strong>Antidepressants:

                      <li><strong>Serotonin Modulators:
                      </strong>   These drugs (e.g., alosetron, for IBS-D) affect gut motility and sensitivity.

                    <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):
                      </strong>   Helps manage the stress and anxiety that often accompany
                      IBS.
                      </li>


                      <li><strong>Gut-Directed Hypnotherapy:
                      </strong>   This therapy focuses on reducing gut hypersensitivity and

                  bacteria, although the effectiveness varies among individuals and probiotic strains.

                      <li><strong>Regular Monitoring: 
                      </strong>   Since IBS is a chronic condition, periodic follow-up with a healthcare
                      provider helps adjust treatment as needed.

                      </strong>    Keeping a record of food intake, bowel habits, and stress levels helps identify
                      triggers.

                      depending on the condition. The surgeon uses a specialized laser fiber to treat the target tissue
                      with precision.

                      with pain medications. The recovery period is shorter than traditional surgery, and most
                      patients can resume normal activities within a few days to a week, depending on the condition
                      treated.
