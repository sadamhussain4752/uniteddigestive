                  <p>Step-by-Step Process:</p>
                  <ul>

                    <li>

                    Consultation and Evaluation: Patients undergo an initial
consultation where their medical history is reviewed, and eligibility
for stem cell therapy is assessed based on the condition and stage
of the disease.

                    </li>

                    <li>

                    Stem Cell Harvesting: Stem cells are sourced from the patient’s
own body (autologous) or from a donor (allogeneic), depending on
the treatment. Common sources include bone marrow, fat tissue,
or umbilical cord blood.

                    </li>

                    <li>

                    Preparation of Stem Cells: The harvested cells are processed in
a lab to concentrate the stem cells. In some cases, specific types
of stem cells are isolated for targeted treatments.

                    </li>
                    <li>

                    Stem Cell Administration: The processed stem cells are injected
directly into the affected area (e.g., joints, spinal cord, etc.) or
delivered through an IV for systemic conditions. This minimally
invasive procedure is typically performed in an outpatient setting.

                    </li>
                    <li>

                    Post-Treatment Monitoring: Patients are monitored to assess the
response to treatment, and follow-up visits are scheduled to
evaluate progress over time.

immune system, improving resistance to infections and reducing chronic
inflammation.

  Increased Energy Levels: Improved mitochondrial function and cellular
repair can result in higher energy levels and better stamina, addressing
fatigue and general sluggishness associated with aging.
  </li>

  Anti-Inflammatory Effects: Reduction in chronic low-grade inflammation,
  which is a hallmark of aging and age-related diseases.
