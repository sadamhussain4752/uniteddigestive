                  Laser surgery is an increasingly popular treatment option for various anorectal conditions due to its
                  precision, technical advancement , minimal invasiveness, and reduced recovery time. It involves the use
                  of laser energy to remove or treat tissues in the anal and rectal area.
                  Hereâ€™s an overview of the common anorectal conditions treated with laser surgery, along with the
                  benefits and general approach.

                  <strong>Laser Hemorrhoidoplasty (LHP)</strong>This procedure is used for the treatment of internal
                  hemorrhoids. A laser fiber is introduced into the hemorrhoidal pile, and laser energy is
                  delivered, causing the hemorrhoid to shrink. It cuts off blood flow to the hemorrhoidal
                  vessels, leading to reduced shrinkage when coagulation occurs and later fibrosed
