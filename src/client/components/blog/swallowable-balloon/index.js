                  The swallowable balloon, also known as the intragastric balloon, is an innovative, non-surgical solution for managing obesity. It offers a minimally invasive approach to help individuals achieve weight loss when traditional methods like diet and exercise have not been effective. This treatment is particularly suitable for individuals who may not qualify for or want to undergo bariatric surgery with expectation to loose minimum weight loss.

                </p>
                <h4>
                  What is a Swallowable Balloon?
                </h4>
                <p className="txt-just">
                  A swallowable balloon is a soft, expandable medical device that is placed inside the stomach to promote feelings of fullness, reducing food intake. Unlike traditional gastric balloons that require endoscopy and sedation for insertion, the swallowable balloon can be swallowed in capsule form and inflated within the stomach using a sterile solution, without the need for anesthesia.

                </p>


                <h4>
                  How It Works
                </h4>
                <p className="txt-just">
                  Once swallowed, the capsule containing the deflated balloon is guided into the stomach, where it is inflated using saline or gas through a small catheter. The balloon then floats freely inside the stomach, taking up space and limiting the amount of food the stomach can hold. As a result, patients experience early satiety and reduced appetite, which helps them consume fewer calories. The balloon remains in place for about 4-6 months, after which it is safely deflated and naturally passed through the digestive system.


                </p>

                    <li>
                      <b>  Non-Surgical & Minimally Invasive:</b> No incisions, stitches, or anesthesia are required, making it a simpler and safer alternative to surgery.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Effective Weight Loss:</b> On average, patients lose 10-15% of their total body weight during the 6 months the balloon is in place.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Quick Procedure:</b> The balloon placement takes about 15-20 minutes, allowing patients to return to their daily activities almost immediately.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Temporary and Reversible:</b> Unlike permanent weight loss surgeries, the swallowable balloon is a temporary aid that can be removed at any time.
                    </li>

                <p className="txt-just">
                  While generally safe, the swallowable balloon may cause temporary side effects such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal discomfort as the body adjusts to the balloon. It's essential for patients to follow a balanced diet and maintain an exercise regimen to maximize the benefits and prevent weight regain after the balloon is removed.
