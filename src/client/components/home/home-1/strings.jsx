    testContone:"Amidst of covid pandemic, my aunt got diagnosed with colon tumor. Local doctors diagnosed it as cancer stage-1. As they stay in my native place Odisha, we were clueless what to do. I live in bangalore. One of my colleague referred Dr. Shabeer. With no delay,i took his appointment and rushed to him. After going through the reports without even checking the patient, he said chemo may not be required. He helped a lot to get my aunt here and directly get admitted to Fortis for surgery. Post surgery, biopsy report revealed that its stage 0 and no need for chemo therapy. Everything just happened ontime and perfectly. When i thanked Dr. Sir, he was humble enough to give the credit to Allaha. Sir, you were a blessing to our family in this crisis. My uncle aunt were so happy and pleased by your interaction in entire process. May God always bless you and help you in serving mankind. Thank you very much.",
