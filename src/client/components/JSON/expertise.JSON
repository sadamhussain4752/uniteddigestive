This common condition is typically not serious and can arise from various factors. Common causes include viral infections, bacterial infections, food allergies, food poisoning, certain medications, artificial sweeteners, and excessive alcohol consumption. Additionally, diarrhoea may be linked to chronic gastrointestinal conditions such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.",

        "answer": "Hemorrhoids — These are dilated blood vessels or veins in the anal or rectal area. They can occur on the outside where they are felt as small bumps when wiping; or they may be on the inside where they are usually painless. They are quite common and are associated with chronic constipation, increased perirectal pressure and with pregnancy."

      {
        "question": "3. What if my diarrhoea doesn’t go away after a few days?",
        "answer": "If your diarrhoea persists for several days, your doctor may recommend tests such as blood and stool samples, X-rays, or ultrasounds. In some cases, a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy may be needed to visually examine the colon using a flexible tube. However, most instances of diarrhoea typically resolve on their own within a few days."
