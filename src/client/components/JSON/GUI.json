      "description": "Gastritis is the inflammation of the stomach lining, which can manifest in two distinct forms. Acute gastritis occurs suddenly and can be triggered by factors such as infections, irritants, or stress. In contrast, chronic gastritis develops gradually over an extended period, often resulting from prolonged exposure to irritants like certain medications, alcohol, or autoimmune disorders. Both forms can lead to discomfort and may require medical attention to manage symptoms and address underlying causes effectively.",
