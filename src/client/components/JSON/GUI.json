    "description": "Frequent and watery bowel movements characterize diarrhoea, which involves an increased fluid content in the stool. This common condition is typically not serious and can arise from various factors. Common causes include viral infections, bacterial infections, food allergies, food poisoning, certain medications, artificial sweeteners, and excessive alcohol consumption. Additionally, diarrhoea may be linked to chronic gastrointestinal conditions such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.",

Acute gastritis occurs suddenly and can be triggered by factors such as infections, irritants, or stress. In contrast, chronic gastritis develops gradually over an extended period, often resulting from prolonged exposure to irritants like certain medications, alcohol, or autoimmune disorders. Both forms can lead to discomfort and may require medical attention to manage symptoms and address underlying causes effectively.",

      },
      {
        "question": "1. Procedure:",
        "answer": "In MGB, a small stomach pouch is created by stapling a part of the stomach vertically to reduce its size. The small intestine is then bypassed by attaching a loop of the intestine (usually about 150–200 cm away from the stomach) to this newly created stomach pouch, allowing food to bypass a significant portion of the stomach and upper intestine."

        "question": "1. Hemorrhoids",
        "answer": " Laser Hemorrhoidoplasty (LHP): This procedure is used for the treatment of internal hemorrhoids. A laser fiber is introduced into the hemorrhoidal pile, and laser energy is delivered, causing the hemorrhoid to shrink. It cuts off blood flow to the hemorrhoidal vessels, leading to reduced shrinkage when coagulation occurs and later fibrosed. Benefits: Minimal bleeding, less post-operative pain, and quicker recovery compared to conventional hemorrhoidectomy."

      {
        "question": "2. Anal Fissures",
        "answer": "Chronic anal fissures can be treated with laser surgery ( LASER LIS) by carefully removing the fissure tissue and promoting healing. The laser helps reduce muscle spasms in the anal sphincter and promotes blood flow to the area. Benefits: Less pain, quicker healing, and reduced risk of infection."

        "question": "3. Fistula-in-Ano",
        "answer": "Many types of Laser, like Laser Ablation of Fistula Tract (LAFT), FILAC ( fistula laser closure In this procedure, a laser probe is inserted into the fistula tract, and laser energy is used to ablate the tract from within. This promotes healing without extensive cutting of tissues. LIFT with LASER/ Distal laser ptoximal ligation.DLPS ( Distal laser proximal sloft.Fixicision (fistula coring with proximal SLOFT.VAAFT with LASER.Benefits: Minimal tissue damage, reduced recurrence rates, quicker recovery, and preservation of anal sphincter function (important for continence)."

        "question": "4. Pilonidal Sinus",
        "answer": "Laser surgery can be used to treat pilonidal sinus disease by ablating the sinus tract and promoting closure. It is particularly beneficial for recurrent cases where traditional surgery has failed. Benefits: Faster healing, less pain, and a lower risk of recurrence."

        "question": "5. Anal Warts (Condyloma)",
        "answer": "Laser therapy is effective for the removal of anal warts caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The laser precisely targets the warts, causing them to vaporize, while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues. Benefits: Precision removal, reduced risk of scarring, and minimal bleeding."
